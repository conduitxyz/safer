# Safer

Safer is a tool that helps you sign & submit transactions to a Safe, without requiring any interaction with Safe's backend or frontend.

Safer is a set of Foundry scripts that can be used as fallback in case Safe App is down and the blockchain is the only thing that can be trusted.

Safer enables submitting complex transactions without the need of intermediaries.

**Safer unlocks true DAO resilience.**

## Getting Started

- Install [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).
- Run `make` to initialize the repository.
- Create a `.env` file from the template [`.env.example`](./.env.example) file.
  - Set the environment variable `SENDER` to the address used to execute the transaction on the Safe. If you don't execute the tx, you don't need to set it.
  - Use the environment variable `SAFE_NONCE` to override a transaction's nonce. Remove it to use the default, latest Safe nonce. Leave it blank to use nonce 0.
  - Use the environment variable `FOUNDRY_ETH_RPC_URL` to customize the RPC endpoint used. This is useful to interact with a Safe deployed on another chain than Ethereum mainnet (the default one).

### Build a Safe tx

- Run `make tx` and follow the steps to create a Safe transaction using [create-safe-tx](https://github.com/morpho-labs/create-safe-tx); OR
- Put the transaction's raw data in `data/tx.json`

### Create a batch

To create a batch of multiple transactions that will be executed atomically:

1. Add the `MULTI_SEND_ADDR` environment variable to your `.env` file with the MultiSend contract address for your Safe version (e.g., `MULTI_SEND_ADDR=0x38869bf66a61cF6bDB996A6aE40D5853Fd43B526` for Safe 1.3.0 on Sepolia)
2. Create a `data/batch.json` file with an array of transaction objects
3. Run `make prepare-batch` to encode the batch into a single Safe transaction

Each transaction in the batch should follow this format:

```json
[
    {
        "operation": 0,
        "to": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        "value": "0",
        "data": "0x"
    },
    {
        "operation": 1,
        "to": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", 
        "value": "1000000000000000000",
        "data": "0x1234567890abcdef"
    }
]
```

Where:
- `operation`: `0` for a call, `1` for a delegatecall
- `to`: target contract address
- `value`: amount of ETH to send (as a string)
- `data`: transaction data (must start with `0x`)

The batch will be encoded using Safe's MultiSend contract and saved to `data/tx.json` for signing and execution.

### Sign a Safe tx

1. To sign the data with a Ledger, run: `make sign:ledger`
2. Share the content of `data/signatures.txt` with the signer who will execute the transaction on the Safe

### Batch signatures and execute transaction

1. Make sure at least `threshold` signatures are available in `data/signatures.txt`, each one per line
2. To execute the transaction on the Safe with a Ledger, run: `make exec:ledger`

## Advanced options

### Hardware Wallet support

With `make sign` & `make exec`, one can also use any other wallet provider available with `cast`:

- `make cmd:interactive` to input the private key to the command prompt
- `make cmd:ledger` to use a Ledger
- `make cmd:trezor` to use a Trezor
- `make cmd:keystore` to use a keystore
- `make cmd:"private-key 0x..."` if you really want to save your private key to your shell's history...

You can also append any `cast` parameter:
- `make sign:"ledger --mnemonic 1 --mnemonic-index 1"` or `make exec:"ledger --mnemonics foo --mnemonic-indexes 1"` to use another account than the default one at index `0`

### Transaction details

```json
{
  "to": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "value": "0", // The tx value (in ETH), must be a string
  "data": "0x", // The raw tx data, must start with 0x
  "operation": 0, // 0 for a call, 1 for a delegatecall
  "safeTxGas": 0,
  "baseGas": 0,
  "gasPrice": 0,
  "gasToken": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", // Indicates the tx will consume the chain's default gas token (ETH on mainnet)
  "refundReceiver": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000" // Indicates the tx's refund receiver will be the address executing the tx
}
```
